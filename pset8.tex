% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{solution}
Assume (i). We claim that $f(\bar{A}) \subseteq \overline{f(A)}$. Let
$y \in f(\bar{A})$. Then, there exists $x \in \bar{A}$, such that
$f(x) = y$. Since $f$ is homeomorphic, it is continuous. 
By continuity of $f$ at $x$, for any neighborhood $O$
of $y$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$, such that $f(U) \subseteq 
O$. As $x \in \bar{A}$, $U \cap A \neq \emptyset$, and $f(U) \cap f(A) 
\neq \emptyset$. Since $f(U) \subseteq O$, $f(A) \cap O \neq \emptyset$. 
Hence, $y \in \overline{f(A)}$. We now claim that
$\overline{f(A)} \subseteq f(\bar{A})$. Let $y \in \overline{f(A)}$.  


\smallskip

Assume $(ii)$, and let $E$ be a closed subset of $X$. We have $X \setminus E$
is open. By $(ii)$, $f(X\setminus E)$ is open. As $f$ is surjective, 
we have $f(X) = Y$. It follows that
\eQb
f(X\setminus E) &=& f(X) \setminus f(E) \\
&=& Y \setminus f(E). 
\eQe
Since $Y \setminus f(E)$ is open, $f(E)$ is closed.

\begin{solution}
Let $Y$ be a topological space that is homeomorphic to $X$, and
$\phi:X \to Y$ be a bijective map such that $\phi^{-1}$ is continuous.
Let $g$ be a continuous real-valued function, defined on $Y$. Consider
$g(Y)$. We wish to show that $\inf_{y \in Y} g(y) \in g(Y)$.

\end{question}
\begin{solution} 
\textbf{(i)} 
Let $\mathscr{T}_1$ be a topology for $X$, that is weaker than $\mathscr{T}$.
It follows that $\mathscr{T}_1 \subseteq \mathscr{T}$. Let $E$ be
a subset of $X$, and $\{O_\lambda \}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ be 
an open cover of $E$ in $(X,\mathscr{T}_1)$. 
As $\mathscr{T}_1 \subseteq \mathscr{T}$, 
the considered open cover is also an open cover in $(X,\mathscr{T})$. 
By compactness of $(X,\mathscr{T})$, 
there exists a finite sub-collection of the open cover, that covers $E$.
Hence, $(X,\mathscr{T}_1)$ is compact. \hfill $\qed$ 

\smallskip

\textbf{(ii)}
Let $\mathscr{T}_2$ be a topology for $X$, that is stronger than 
$\mathscr{T}$. It follows that $\mathscr{T} \subseteq \mathscr{T}_2$. 
If $|X| < 2$, $X$ with any topology is trivially Hausdorff. Hence,
we only consider the remaining case of $|X| \geq 2$. 
Let $x,y \in X$ such that $x \neq y$. As $(X,\mathscr{T})$ is Hausdorff,
there exists a neighborhood of $x$, and a neighborhood of $y$, that are
disjoint, which we denote as $U$ and $V$ respectively. As 
$\mathscr{T} \subseteq \mathscr{T}_2$, $U$ and $V$ are also open in 
$(X,\mathscr{T}_2)$. Hence, $U$ is a neighborhood of $x$, and $V$
is a neighborhood of $y$ in $(X,\mathscr{T}_2)$. Moreover, $U$ and $V$ are
disjoint. Hence, $(X,\mathscr{T}_2)$ is Hausdorff. \hfill $\qed$
 
\smallskip

\textbf{(iii)} 
Let $\mathscr{T}_1$
be a topology for $X$, that is strictly weaker than $\mathscr{T}$. It follows
that there exists a subset $E$ of $X$ such that it is open in 
$(X,\mathscr{T})$, but not open in $(X,\mathscr{T}_1)$. Furthermore, 
$X \setminus E$ is closed in $(X,\mathscr{T})$, but not closed in
$(X\mathscr{T}_1)$. As $(X,\mathscr{T})$ is compact, $X \setminus E$
is compact as a subspace.
Since $\mathscr{T}_1$ is weaker than $\mathscr{T}$, 
$X\setminus E$ is compact. 
Suppose for sake of contradiction that $(X,\mathscr{T}_1)$
is Hausdorff. It implies that $X \setminus E$ is closed in
$(X,\mathscr{T})$, which is a contradiction. Hence, $(X,\mathscr{T}_1)$
is not Hausdorff. \hfill $\qed$

\smallskip
 
Let $\mathscr{T}_2$ be a topology for $X$, that is strictly stronger than
$\mathscr{T}$. It follows that there exists a subset $E$ of $X$ such that
it is open in $(X,\mathscr{T}_2)$, but not open in $(X,\mathscr{T})$. 
Furthermore, $X\setminus E$ is closed in $(X,\mathscr{T}_2)$, but not
closed in $(X,\mathscr{T})$. Suppose for sake of contradiction that 
$(X,\mathscr{T}_2)$ is compact. Then, as $X \setminus E$ is closed in $(X,
\mathscr{T}_2)$ is compact. As $\mathscr{T}$ is weaker than 
$\mathscr{T}_2$, $X \setminus E$ is compact in $(X,\mathscr{T})$. As
$(X\mathscr{T})$ is Hausdorff, $X\setminus E$ is closed in $(X,\mathscr{T})$,
which is a contradiction. Hence, $(X,\mathscr{T}_2)$ is not compact.
